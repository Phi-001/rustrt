Here's the rough plan for features

Switch to monte carlo integration
    - Change material to work with PDF
        - Scatter function as well as reflectance function
        - Handle specular with special case
    - Make the ray_color function non recursive so it is easier to see in performance

Add more shapes
    - Add quads
    - Add boxes which are made of quads
    - Make use of the Transform class to be able to place it anywhere

Add light
    - This should also use PDF

Add volumetric
    - Simple fog would be fine
    - Heterogenous volumes are for later

Switch to bidirectional

Implement a better sampler
    - Poly jittered whatever

Switch to MTL
